In this repo I have demonstrated the use of Support vector Machine(SVM) in Cancer Cells Dataset.

The dataset contains 700 rows and features like:

D	
Clump	
UnifSize	
UnifShape	
MargAdh	
SingEpiSize	
BareNuc	
BlandChrom	
NormNucl	
Mit	
Class


I have cleaned all the data and performed data preprocessing and data visualization and also calculated the various accuracy scores like F1 score, jaccard index and confusion matrix.
